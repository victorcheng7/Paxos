only 1
child 1
Much 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
attached 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
draw 1
inexhaustible 1
stores 1
of 1
affection 1
from 1
a 1
very 1
mine 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
bestow 1
them 1
upon 1
me 1
My 1
mothers 1
tender 1
caresses 1
and 1
my 1
fathers 1
smile 1
of 1
benevolent 1
pleasure 1
while 1
regarding 1
me 1
are 1
my 1
first 1
recollections 1
I 1
was 1
their 1
plaything 1
and 1
their 1
idol 1
and 1
something 1
better 1
their 1
child 1
the 1
innocent 1
and 1
helpless 1
creature 1
bestowed 1
on 1
them 1
by 1
heaven 1
whom 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
to 1
good 1
and 1
whose 1
future 1
lot 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
to 1
direct 1
to 1
happiness 1
or 1
misery 1
according 1
as 1
they 1
fulfilled 1
their 1
duties 1
towards 1
me 1
With 1
this 1
deep 1
consciousness 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
owed 1
towards 1
the 1
being 1
to 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
given 1
life 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
active 1
spirit 1
of 1
tenderness 1
that 1
animated 1
both 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
imagined 1
that 1
while 1
during 1
every 1
hour 1
of 1
my 1
infant 1
life 1
I 1
received 1
a 1
lesson 1
of 1
patience 1
of 1
charity 1
and 1
of 1
selfcontrol 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
guided 1
by 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
that 1
all 1
seemed 1
but 1
one 1
train 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
to 1
me 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
their 1
only 1
care 1
My 1
mother 1
had 1
much 1
desired 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
daughter 1
but 1
I 1
continued 1
their 1
single 1
offspring 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
years 1
old 1
while 1
making 1
an 1
excursion 1
beyond 1
the 1
frontiers 1
of 1
Italy 1
they 1
passed 1
a 1
week 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
Lake 1
of 1
Como 1
Their 1
benevolent 1
disposition 1
often 1
made 1
them 1
enter 1
the 1
cottages 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
This 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
duty 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
necessity 1
a 1
passion 1
remembering 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
suffered 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
relieved 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
act 1
in 1
her 1
turn 1
the 1
guardian 1
angel 1
to 1
the 1
afflicted 1
During 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
walks 1
a 1
poor 1
cot 1
in 1
the 1
foldings 1
of 1
a 1
vale 1
attracted 1
their 1
notice 1
as 1
being 1
singularly 1
disconsolate 1
while 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
halfclothed 1
children 1
gathered 1
about 1
it 1
spoke 1
of 1
penury 1
in 1
its 1
worst 1
shape 1
One 1
day 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
himself 1
to 1
Milan 1
my 1
mother 1
accompanied 1
by 1
me 1
visited 1
this 1
abode 1
She 1
found 1
a 1
peasant 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
hard 1
working 1
bent 1
down 1
by 1
care 1
and 1
labour 1
distributing 1
a 1
scanty 1
meal 1
to 1
five 1
hungry 1
babes 1
Among 1
these 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
attracted 1
my 1
mother 1
far 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
She 1
appeared 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
stock 1
The 1
four 1
others 1
were 1
darkeyed 1
hardy 1
little 1
vagrants 1
this 1
child 1
was 1
thin 1
and 1
very 1
fair 1
Her 1
hair 1
was 1
the 1
brightest 1
living 1
gold 1
and 1
despite 1
the 1
poverty 1
of 1
her 1
clothing 1
seemed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
crown 1
of 1
distinction 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
Her 1
brow 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
ample 1
her 1
blue 1
eyes 1
cloudless 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
moulding 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
so 1
expressive 1
of 1
sensibility 1
and 1
sweetness 1
that 1
none 1
could 1
behold 1
her 1
without 1
looking 1
on 1
her 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
distinct 1
species 1
a 1
being 1
heavensent 1
and 1
bearing 1
a 1
celestial 1
stamp 1
in 1
all 1
her 1
features 1
The 1
peasant 1
woman 1
perceiving 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
fixed 1
eyes 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
admiration 1
on 1
this 1
lovely 1
girl 1
eagerly 1
communicated 1
her 1
history 1
She 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
child 1
but 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
Milanese 1
nobleman 1
Her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
German 1
and 1
had 1
died 1
on 1
giving 1
her 1
birth 1
The 1
infant 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
with 1
these 1
good 1
people 1
to 1
nurse 1
they 1
were 1
better 1
off 1
then 1
They 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
long 1
married 1
and 1
their 1
eldest 1
child 1
was 1
but 1
just 1
born 1
The 1
father 1
of 1
their 1
charge 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
Italians 1
nursed 1
in 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
antique 1
glory 1
of 1
Italy 1
one 1
among 1
the 1
schiavi 1
ognor 1
frementi 1
who 1
exerted 1
himself 1
to 1
obtain 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
He 1
became 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
its 1
weakness 1
Whether 1
he 1
had 1
died 1
or 1
still 1
lingered 1
in 1
the 1
dungeons 1
of 1
Austria 1
was 1
not 1
known 1
His 1
property 1
was 1
confiscated 1
his 1
child 1
became 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
She 1
continued 1
with 1
her 1
foster 1
parents 1
and 1
bloomed 1
in 1
their 1
rude 1
abode 1
fairer 1
than 1
a 1
garden 1
rose 1
among 1
darkleaved 1
brambles 1
When 1
my 1
father 1
returned 1
from 1
Milan 1
he 1
found 1
playing 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
our 1
villa 1
a 1
child 1
fairer 1
than 1
pictured 1
cherub 1
a 1
creature 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
shed 1
radiance 1
from 1
her 1
looks 1
and 1
whose 1
form 1
and 1
motions 1
were 1
lighter 1
than 1
the 1
chamois 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
The 1
apparition 1
was 1
soon 1
explained 1
With 1
his 1
permission 1
my 1
mother 1
prevailed 1
on 1
her 1
rustic 1
guardians 1
to 1
yield 1
their 1
charge 1
to 1
her 1
They 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
the 1
sweet 1
orphan 1
Her 1
presence 1
had 1
seemed 1
a 1
blessing 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
unfair 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
want 1
when 1
Providence 1
afforded 1
her 1
such 1
powerful 1
protection 1
They 1
consulted 1
their 1
village 1
priest 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
that 1
Elizabeth 1
Lavenza 1
became 1
the 1
inmate 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
house 1
my 1
more 1
than 1
sister 1
the 1
beautiful 1
and 1
adored 1
companion 1
of 1
all 1
my 1
occupations 1
and 1
my 1
pleasures 1
Everyone 1
loved 1
Elizabeth 1
The 1
passionate 1
and 1
almost 1
reverential 1
attachment 1
with 1
which 1
all 1
regarded 1
her 1
became 1
while 1
I 1
shared 1
it 1
my 1
pride 1
and 1
my 1
delight 1
On 1
the 1
evening 1
previous 1
to 1
her 1
being 1
brought 1
to 1
my 1
home 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
said 1
playfully 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
pretty 1
present 1
for 1
my 1
Victor 1
tomorrow 1
he 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
And 1
when 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
she 1
presented 1
Elizabeth 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
promised 1
gift 1
I 1
with 1
childish 1
seriousness 1
interpreted 1
her 1
words 1
literally 1
and 1
looked 1
upon 1
Elizabeth 1
as 1
mine 1
mine 1
to 1
protect 1
love 1
and 1
cherish 1
All 1
praises 1
bestowed 1
on 1
her 1
I 1
received 1
as 1
made 1
to 1
a 1
possession 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
We 1
called 1
each 1
other 1
familiarly 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
cousin 1
No 1
word 1
no 1
expression 1
could 1
body 1
forth 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
relation 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
stood 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
more 1
than 1
sister 1
since 1
till 1
death 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
mine 1
only 1
