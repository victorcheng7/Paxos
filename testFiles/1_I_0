I 1
am 1
by 1
birth 1
a 1
Genevese 1
and 1
my 1
family 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
of 1
that 1
republic 1
My 1
ancestors 1
had 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
counsellors 1
and 1
syndics 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
filled 1
several 1
public 1
situations 1
with 1
honour 1
and 1
reputation 1
He 1
was 1
respected 1
by 1
all 1
who 1
knew 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
integrity 1
and 1
indefatigable 1
attention 1
to 1
public 1
business 1
He 1
passed 1
his 1
younger 1
days 1
perpetually 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
circumstances 1
had 1
prevented 1
his 1
marrying 1
early 1
nor 1
was 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
husband 1
and 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
a 1
family 1
As 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
his 1
marriage 1
illustrate 1
his 1
character 1
I 1
cannot 1
refrain 1
from 1
relating 1
them 1
One 1
of 1
his 1
most 1
intimate 1
friends 1
was 1
a 1
merchant 1
who 1
from 1
a 1
flourishing 1
state 1
fell 1
through 1
numerous 1
mischances 1
into 1
poverty 1
This 1
man 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
Beaufort 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
proud 1
and 1
unbending 1
disposition 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
oblivion 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
country 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
distinguished 1
for 1
his 1
rank 1
and 1
magnificence 1
Having 1
paid 1
his 1
debts 1
therefore 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
honourable 1
manner 1
he 1
retreated 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
Lucerne 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
unknown 1
and 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
My 1
father 1
loved 1
Beaufort 1
with 1
the 1
truest 1
friendship 1
and 1
was 1
deeply 1
grieved 1
by 1
his 1
retreat 1
in 1
these 1
unfortunate 1
circumstances 1
He 1
bitterly 1
deplored 1
the 1
false 1
pride 1
which 1
led 1
his 1
friend 1
to 1
a 1
conduct 1
so 1
little 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
affection 1
that 1
united 1
them 1
He 1
lost 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
seek 1
him 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
persuading 1
him 1
to 1
begin 1
the 1
world 1
again 1
through 1
his 1
credit 1
and 1
assistance 1
Beaufort 1
had 1
taken 1
effectual 1
measures 1
to 1
conceal 1
himself 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
ten 1
months 1
before 1
my 1
father 1
discovered 1
his 1
abode 1
Overjoyed 1
at 1
this 1
discovery 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
was 1
situated 1
in 1
a 1
mean 1
street 1
near 1
the 1
Reuss 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
misery 1
and 1
despair 1
alone 1
welcomed 1
him 1
Beaufort 1
had 1
saved 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
from 1
the 1
wreck 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
provide 1
him 1
with 1
sustenance 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
hoped 1
to 1
procure 1
some 1
respectable 1
employment 1
in 1
a 1
merchants 1
house 1
The 1
interval 1
was 1
consequently 1
spent 1
in 1
inaction 1
his 1
grief 1
only 1
became 1
more 1
deep 1
and 1
rankling 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
leisure 1
for 1
reflection 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
it 1
took 1
so 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
three 1
months 1
he 1
lay 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
sickness 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
exertion 1
His 1
daughter 1
attended 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
tenderness 1
but 1
she 1
saw 1
with 1
despair 1
that 1
their 1
little 1
fund 1
was 1
rapidly 1
decreasing 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
prospect 1
of 1
support 1
But 1
Caroline 1
Beaufort 1
possessed 1
a 1
mind 1
of 1
an 1
uncommon 1
mould 1
and 1
her 1
courage 1
rose 1
to 1
support 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
adversity 1
She 1
procured 1
plain 1
work 1
she 1
plaited 1
straw 1
and 1
by 1
various 1
means 1
contrived 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
pittance 1
scarcely 1
sufficient 1
to 1
support 1
life 1
Several 1
months 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
Her 1
father 1
grew 1
worse 1
her 1
time 1
was 1
more 1
entirely 1
occupied 1
in 1
attending 1
him 1
her 1
means 1
of 1
subsistence 1
decreased 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
tenth 1
month 1
her 1
father 1
died 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
leaving 1
her 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
This 1
last 1
blow 1
overcame 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
knelt 1
by 1
Beauforts 1
coffin 1
weeping 1
bitterly 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
the 1
chamber 1
He 1
came 1
like 1
a 1
protecting 1
spirit 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
who 1
committed 1
herself 1
to 1
his 1
care 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
interment 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
he 1
conducted 1
her 1
to 1
Geneva 1
and 1
placed 1
her 1
under 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
a 1
relation 1
Two 1
years 1
after 1
this 1
event 1
Caroline 1
became 1
his 1
wife 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
difference 1
between 1
the 1
ages 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
but 1
this 1
circumstance 1
seemed 1
to 1
unite 1
them 1
only 1
closer 1
in 1
bonds 1
of 1
devoted 1
affection 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
justice 1
in 1
my 1
fathers 1
upright 1
mind 1
which 1
rendered 1
it 1
necessary 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
approve 1
highly 1
to 1
love 1
strongly 1
Perhaps 1
during 1
former 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
from 1
the 1
latediscovered 1
unworthiness 1
of 1
one 1
beloved 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
disposed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
greater 1
value 1
on 1
tried 1
worth 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
gratitude 1
and 1
worship 1
in 1
his 1
attachment 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
differing 1
wholly 1
from 1
the 1
doting 1
fondness 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
inspired 1
by 1
reverence 1
for 1
her 1
virtues 1
and 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
recompensing 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
sorrows 1
she 1
had 1
endured 1
but 1
which 1
gave 1
inexpressible 1
grace 1
to 1
his 1
behaviour 1
to 1
her 1
Everything 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
her 1
wishes 1
and 1
her 1
convenience 1
He 1
strove 1
to 1
shelter 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
fair 1
exotic 1
is 1
sheltered 1
by 1
the 1
gardener 1
from 1
every 1
rougher 1
wind 1
and 1
to 1
surround 1
her 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
could 1
tend 1
to 1
excite 1
pleasurable 1
emotion 1
in 1
her 1
soft 1
and 1
benevolent 1
mind 1
Her 1
health 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
of 1
her 1
hitherto 1
constant 1
spirit 1
had 1
been 1
shaken 1
by 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
During 1
the 1
two 1
years 1
that 1
had 1
elapsed 1
previous 1
to 1
their 1
marriage 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gradually 1
relinquished 1
all 1
his 1
public 1
functions 1
and 1
immediately 1
after 1
their 1
union 1
they 1
sought 1
the 1
pleasant 1
climate 1
of 1
Italy 1
and 1
the 1
change 1
of 1
scene 1
and 1
interest 1
attendant 1
on 1
a 1
tour 1
through 1
that 1
land 1
of 1
wonders 1
as 1
a 1
restorative 1
for 1
her 1
weakened 1
frame 1
From 1
Italy 1
they 1
visited 1
Germany 1
and 1
France 1
I 1
their 1
eldest 1
child 1
was 1
born 1
at 1
Naples 1
and 1
as 1
an 1
infant 1
accompanied 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
rambles 1
I 1
remained 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
thei 1
